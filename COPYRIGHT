APPENDIX A. EVALUATION NOTE

This online store is powered by X-Cart shopping-cart-software.

This X-Cart installation is licensed for evaluation purposes only so this message should be kept visible at the top of every store page. For details refer to X-Cart license agreement.

Removing this message without buying a paid license is prohibited and will result in legal proceedings.

APPENDIX B. EXAMPLES EXPLAINING THE ONE-LICENSE-ONE-STORE RULE

1. If your store is accessible from multiple domains but the content is the same for each link, this is OK and does not require multiple licenses.

2. If your store is accessible from multiple domains but each domain shows a different storefront skin style, this is OK and does not require multiple licenses.

3. If your multiple stores are located at sub-domains or in sub-directories of the same domain, the license for each store is required.

4. If your store is accessible from multiple domains and your store is customized to show/hide/alter certain part of content based on the domain, the license for each domain is required. In this situation the stores appear to have separate content thereby making them separate stores in the eyes of the license agreement. The content needs to be the same for each domain in order to qualify as a single store.
