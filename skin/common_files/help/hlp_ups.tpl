<b>Merchant account types description</b>
<br />
UPS has several classifications based on your account-type choice:
<br />
<i>Daily Pickup</i> - a UPS driver will come to your location each day (weekly service charge applies)
<br />
<i>Occasional Shipper</i> - It is the responsibility of the merchant to drop the package into the UPS System
<br />
<i>Suggested Retail Rate</i> - Paying for the shipments at the UPS Store (Label is actually created by the UPS Store)
<br />
With a Daily Pickup Account, a UPS driver will make a regular stop at your location each day, Monday through Friday, to pick up all package types, including:
<ul>
<li>Ground shipments</li>
<li>Air shipments</li>
<li>International shipments</li>
</ul>
<b>NOTE:</b> A weekly service charge applies, and Daily Rates will be billed to your UPS Account (see the <b>UPS Rates</b> section under Terms and Conditions of Service in the online UPS Service Guide).
<br />
With an Occasional Account, you decide if and when you need to schedule a UPS driver to pickup your shipments. Once you have prepared your shipments, you have the following options:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Schedule an On Call Pickup to have your shipment picked up by a UPS driver for a nominal fee.</li>
<li>Hand your shipments to any UPS driver in your area.</li>
<li>Take your shipments to The UPS Store, a UPS Customer Center, or an Authorized Shipping Outlet.</li>
<li>Drop off your Air, Ground or International shipments at one of over 60,000 UPS locations.</li>
</ul>
<b>NOTE:</b> No weekly service charge applies. UPS On Demand rates will be billed to your UPS Account (see the <b>UPS Rates</b> section under Terms and Conditions of Service in the online UPS Service Guide).
