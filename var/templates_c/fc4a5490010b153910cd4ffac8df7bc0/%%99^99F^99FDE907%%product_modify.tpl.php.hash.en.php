Instead, you can treat them as one product and sell them under the same product title. To enable your customers to choose the necessary product variation, you can describe the difference between the variations using product options. Your customers will choose the desired combination of product options and thus will let you know which of the variations they want.<br />This section allows you to define groups of product options so that each of these groups will point to a specific property of the product (like 'Color' or 'Size'). Product options will be specific values of these properties (like Red, Blue, Brown for 'Color', or S, M, L, XL for 'Size').<br /><font class='Star'>When you add option groups and define their type, please keep in mind that adding many product variants slows the cart down.
