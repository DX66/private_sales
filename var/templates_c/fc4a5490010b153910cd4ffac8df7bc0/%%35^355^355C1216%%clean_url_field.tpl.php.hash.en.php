Dynamic URLs containing query strings pose a problem for SEO, because they stop many search engines from indexing the pages in which they are used. They are also hard to read.<br />X-Cart provides a functionality that allows you to solve the problem of dynamic URLs: the so-called "clean" URLs. "Clean" URLs are custom SEO-friendly URLs that are used instead of the original dynamic ones.";}
