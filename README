Because of bugs in Opera v10.0, X-Cart will not work in this browser when an IP address is used in the store URL. Please use a domain name or upgrade/change your browser.

II. INSTALLATION
================

For detailed instructions on X-Cart installation, refer to the User manual for 
your X-Cart version.


III. COMMENTS FOR DEVELOPER
===========================

There are several ways to customize the look and feel of X-Cart:

1. You can modify the Smarty templates out of which the store's pages are built.
The templates can be edited using X-Cart's "Edit templates" or "Webmaster mode" 
features or any decent text editor.

2. You can modify the presentation of the store's pages (color, etc) by editing 
X-Cart's CSS files. These files can be edited using X-Cart's "Edit templates"
feature or any decent text editor.

3. You can upload your own images for use in the store's user interface to
the directory <xcart-dir>/skin1/images/ and get the store's templates to use 
them. The images can be uploaded using FTP or X-Cart's "Edit templates" feature. 
4. Most  of  X-Cart  texts  are  stored in "language variables".  You can  edit 
language  variables  under  the  "Languages" section  of  the  admin interface.

For information on Smarty, refer to the Smarty manual at 
http://www.smarty.net/manual/en/.

For detailed information on editing X-Cart's template and CSS files, as well as 
instructions for editing X-Cart's language variables, refer to the User manual 
for your X-Cart version.
